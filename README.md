# Game title : The walk 

We have a map on which there is a robot (in the upper left corner). On the map
there's a location where the robot has to get to. At each step the robot chooses a
the new position to move, so that the new position brings it one step
closer to the final location. Also on the map are distributed traps and
Items that can help the robot on its journey. Some items can only be used
if the robot type is compatible with the item. The robot can execute a move
not more than one position per round, and the new position cannot be at a distance
1 to the position in which it is alpha. But the robot can "see" to the fullest
Four positions from his current position.
